# Minesweeper

This is a CLI minesweeper game made in Java.

### Some things to note:
- Parts of the game are configurable, notably the grid size itself and the amount of mines (within certain constraints).
- There is mechanic to place flags.
- Revealing a single tile does not reveal surrounding "safe" tiles.
- Revealing a single tile will display the number of mines around its (the single tile's) surrounding tiles.

### Win condition
- Reveal all "safe" tiles and leave all mines unrevealed.

### Lose condition
- Reveal a mine.

This app is my first foray into Java. 
The code is procedural and does not incorporate OOP.
Might consider a refactor when Java & OOP understanding improves.

Tutorial-free project.
